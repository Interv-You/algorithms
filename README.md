# Algorithms

## Description
This project contains multiple algorithm exercises split into three different levels:
- basics
- intermediates
- experts

Those algorithms are available in two languages:
- java
- typescript

You will be asked to do some of them, using the language you prefer.

## Algorithms list

### basics
- Swap numbers
- Anagram
- Palindrome
- prime
- Fibonacci
- Two sum

### intermediates
- Add two numbers
- roman

### experts
/

## How to use work on an Algorithm

### Java
under `java/algorithm-test/src/main/java/com/lia/interview` you will found all the algorithm to implement.
Each exercise contains:
- Documentation with all the instructions
- A method with a `// Implement the algorithm here` comment to indicate you where you should work

under `java/algorithm-test/src/test/java/com/lia/interview` you will found all the available tests to execute to ensure your algorithm is working.

You have to write the implementation of the algorithm you where asked for.
To test your algorithm implementation, you can run the corresponding tests.

### Typescript
under `typescript/algorithm-test/src` you will found all the algorithms to implement, and for each of them their corresponding tests.
Each exercise contains:
- Documentation with all the instructions
- A method with a `// Implement the algorithm here` comment to indicate you where you should work

You have to write the implementation of the algorithm you where asked for.
To test your algorithm implementation, you can run the corresponding tests.
