/*
 * Given two strings 's1' and 's2', determine if they are anagrams of each other.
 * An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using each letter exactly once.
 * You may assume that strings contain only letters (no spaces, numbers, or special characters).
 * The comparison is case-sensitive ('A' is not equal to 'a').
 *
 * Example:
 *   input: s1 = "listen", s2 = "silent"
 *   output should be true (because "listen" and "silent" use the same letters)
 *
 *   input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world"
 *   output should be false (different letters used)
