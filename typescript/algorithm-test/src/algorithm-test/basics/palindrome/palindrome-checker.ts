/*
 * Given a string 'value', determine if it is a palindrome.
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
 * The comparison is not case-sensitive ('A' should be equal to 'a').
 * Empty string is considered as a palindrome.
 * Spaces are not taken into account.
 *
 * Example:
 *   input: value = "radar"
 *   output should be true (because "radar" reads the same forwards and backwards)
 *
 *   input: value = "Race a car"
 *   output should be false (different when read backwards)
 *
 *   input: value = "never odd or even"
 *   output should be true
 *
 * Bonus: Performance expectation: O(n)
