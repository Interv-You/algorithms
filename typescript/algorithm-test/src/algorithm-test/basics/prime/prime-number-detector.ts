/*
 * Given a number, determine if it is prime.
 * A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
 *
 * Example:
 *   input: number = 2
 *   output should be true (2 is the smallest prime number)
 *
 *   input: number = 7
 *   output should be true (7 is only divisible by 1 and 7)
 *
 *   input: number = 4
 *   output should be false (4 is divisible by 1, 2, and 4)
 *
 *   input: number = 0
 *   output should be false (0 is not a prime number)
 *
 *   input: number = -3
 *   output should be false (negative numbers cannot be prime)
 *
 * Bonus: Performance expectation: O(âˆšn)
