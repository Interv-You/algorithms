/*
 * Given an array of numbers 'nums' and a number 'target', return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to 'target'.
 * You May assume that each input would have EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION, and you may not use the same element twice.
 * You can return the answer in any order
 *
 * Example:
 *   input = [3,6,5,15], target=9
 *   output should be [3,6] (because 3+6 = 9)
 *
 * Bonus: Performance expectation: less than O(n2)
