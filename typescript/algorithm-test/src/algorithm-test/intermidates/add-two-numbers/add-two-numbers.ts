/*
 * Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, add the numbers and return their sum as a linked list.
 * The digits are stored in reverse order in the linked lists, and each node contains a single digit (0-9).
 * Each linked list contains non-negative integers
 * No leading zeros in the numbers (except for zero itself)
 *
 * The result should also be in reverse order.
 *
 * Example:
 *   input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
 *   output should be [7,0,8]
 *   explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
 *
 *   input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
 *   output should be [0]
 *   explanation: 0 + 0 = 0
 *
 *   input: l1 = [9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9]
 *   output should be [8,9,9,0,1]
 *   explanation: 9999 + 999 = 10998
