/*
 * Convert a given integer to its Roman numeral representation.
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M
 *
 * Symbol Values:
 * - I = 1
 * - V = 5
 * - X = 10
 * - L = 50
 * - C = 100
 * - D = 500
 * - M = 1000
 *
 * Numbers are written from left to right, from highest to lowest value
 * When a smaller value appears before a larger value, it means subtraction
 * A symbol cannot be repeated more than three times consecutively
 * You may assume that number > 0 and number < 3999
 *
 * Example:
 *   input: number = 3
 *   output should be "III"
 *
 *   input: number = 4
 *   output should be "IV"
 *
 *   input: number = 9
 *   output should be "IX"
 *
 *   input: number = 58
 *   output should be "LVIII" (L = 50, V = 5, III = 3)
 *
 *   input: number = 1994
 *   output should be "MCMXCIV" (M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IV = 4)
 *
 *   input: number = 3999
 *   output should be "MMMCMXCIX" (maximum possible value)
 *
 * Bonus: Performance expectation: O(1) as the input range is fixed
